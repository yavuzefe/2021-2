Description
============

Your job is to enable users to give a rating between 1 (bad) and 5 (great), 
and then display that rating in the form of an emoji. The users should give 
their ratings by pressing a key on their keyboards (the numbers 1 to 5). 
Here's the numbers' corresponding emojis:

5 = 😁
3 = 🙂
3 = 😐
2 = ☹️
1 = 🤬

event listeners, keyboard events, key codes, 
focus, focusout, DOM manipulation, tabindex


Detailed Instructions
============
1. Listen for keyboard events when the box has focus
2. Figure out which key the user pressed
3. If it's between 1 and 5, display an emoji in the box!

STRETCH GOALS:
============
- Animate the emoji onto the screen! Why not go crazy with multiple emojis? 
- Reset the entire app when box doesn't have focus anymore
- Can you improve the overall design?
